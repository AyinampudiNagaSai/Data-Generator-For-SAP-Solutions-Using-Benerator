# Data-Generator-For-SAP-Solutions-Using-Benerator


Data analysis has proven useful in the present scenario for businesses when it comes to improving their business processes. Ideally, complete access to data is important for the production of high-quality and accurate analyses. How-ever, real-world data is often subject to several privacy constraints, making them unavailable at full-granularity for some analyses. This can significantly impact the quality of the analysis based on it.Under these constraints, re-searchers often resort to generating realistic synthetic data to verify the efficacy of various methods. It is critical that the generated realistic data needs to be ’realistic’ (i.e., follow the same distributions / trends found in the real world data that it attempts to approximate) for the analysis based on it to be useful. This project focuses on the use of ’Benerator’, an open-source tool for the efficient generation of large amounts of realistic data for various SAP solutions. Different analyses are performed on this data to verify that it approximates distributions found in real-world data.
